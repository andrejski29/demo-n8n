      "gpt_en": "\n  Brighton & Hove Albion vs Everton, The American Express Community Stadium — kick-off Feb 1. A tight, home-edge fixture with betting angles built around control, pace and set-piece action.\n\n  \n    Odds snapshot: Brighton win 1.83; draw 3.60; Everton win 4.10. Safe cover: Double Chance Brighton Win or Draw 1.25. Over/Under 2.5 goals at 1.90 (over) and 1.96 (under).\n    Attacks vs shields: Brighton’s home xG edge (1.71) vs Everton’s away xG (1.05) suggests the hosts should press the tempo. Everton away xG conceded stands at 1.75, so they can be fragile on counters.\n    Scoring pace: Prior averages lean towards the under 2.5 goals (64% under 2.5), despite a listed average total around 2.32. The 2.5 line is priced to tempt, but expect a cautious start with potential late pressure.\n    Corners and tempo: Over 7.5 corners at 1.25 hints at a busy match on the flanks; Brighton are more likely to edge the corner count. If you’re chasing volume, this is a plausible angle.\n    Clean sheets: Not a lock for either side; Brighton at 2.62 and Everton at 4.33 to keep a clean sheet—use as a secondary line rather than a primary call.\n  \n\n  Prediction: Brighton to win, likely 1-0 or 2-1. Safer angle: Brighton Win or Draw. Value angle: Under 2.5 goals fits the broader trend, while Over 2.5 could offer a late-game payoff if both sides open up.\n",
